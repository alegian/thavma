A complete rewrite & reimagination of my favorite classic magic mod, for Neoforge!Thavma means miracle in greek. This mod is all about manipulating the elements of nature, and creating powerful arcane contraptions.![a thavma user, on a platform with magical devices](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/1f98a12ef6fe7e555430a66580d968f0ee9ae85a.png)To get started, craft a basic wand, and right click a bookcase, to obtain the guide book: ![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_1eda43c7-b5fc-42ab-9d16-d3ab41f17957.png)![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_8876b566-cc23-4ca8-a6c9-00c7d3d10d2c.png)That book will allow you to research and discover magical equipment and blocks!![research book preview](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f0685b6557be9868b6833aa9a349287db2632e55.png)**This mod is in alpha**, so many features are work-in-progress. I am doing my best to reach a feature complete version asap.![the infusion altar, on a platform of greatwood planks](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/39b4275c431548e227ee29bfdd553216099d1e86_0.webp)All code is original and open source.
