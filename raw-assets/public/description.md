A complete rewrite & reimagination of my favorite classic magic mod, for Neoforge!Thavma means miracle in greek. This mod is all about manipulating the elements of nature, and creating powerful arcane contraptions. To get started, craft a basic wand, and right click a bookcase, to obtain the guide book:![image](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_c918c158-1a5e-4a49-8df0-6bc6a6b5ec53.png) ![image](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_20c7c6ce-9b1d-40e4-81f8-f6096a594951.png)That book will allow you to research and discover magical equipment and blocks!![image](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_5b575c0c-3140-4658-86d8-98905833e667.png)**This mod is in early alpha**, do not expect it to be playable yet. I am doing my best to reach a stable release asap.![the infusion altar, on a platform of greatwood planks](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1271073/description_465ac439-b6c6-44b6-9b4a-05dcccfa81f2.png)All code is original and open source.
